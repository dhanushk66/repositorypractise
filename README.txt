## This is the official Github Repository for submission number 74, "Coded Term Discovery for Online Hate Speech Detection" at The 11th IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA 2024)
### Here is the description for the each file in the repository:
**Antisemitism_term_definition.csv** : It contains the definition of all the antisemitic seed words we have used in the paper.

**Baseline Results.ipynb** : Python code file for solution 1-1, 1-2 from table 3 in the paper.

**Finetune_bertmodel_pyrradataset.ipynb**: Python code file for finetuning BERT model using our custom dataset. 

**ReportingLayerData_Bertembeddings.ipynb**: Python code file for solution 2-1, 2-2 from table 3 in the paper.

**SRI Coding Statement.pdf**: The coding statement designed by data team to show why the terms are considered as seed terms. 

**Solution 1-1.csv**: The excel file that shows prediction of emerging term using appraoch 1 in phase 1 and approach 1 in phase 2 in section V. 

**Solution 1-2.csv**: The excel file that shows prediction of emerging term using appraoch 1 in phase 1 and approach 2 in phase 2 in section V. 

**Solution 2-1.csv**: The excel file that shows prediction of emerging term using appraoch 2 in phase 1 and approach 1 in phase 2 in section V. 

**Solution 2-2.csv**: The excel file that shows prediction of emerging term using appraoch 2 in phase 1 and approach 2 in phase 2 in section V. 

**Unmasking Antisemitism SRI Data Set - Reporting Layer.csv**: The actual data file we used for the paper. 

**Preprocess.py**: A python function which is used by other python file for a part preprocessing.
